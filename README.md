This is the final version of Juanita's GUI source code, the main code is "juanita_gui.py".

Install all the necessary libraries like opencv, SpeechRecognition or pyttsx3, also PyAudio.
In the last commit there is a new functionality, the "b√∫scame" word, so **remember** to download chromedriver and the version that you may need, follow me in TikTok for the tutorial.
